1. "near_sdk": This is the Near Protocol SDK that will be used across all the files for interacting with the Near blockchain.

2. "serde": This is a serialization framework for Rust. It will be used in "model.rs" for defining the data schema for the UserSession and in "lib.rs", "session.rs", "utils.rs", "integration.rs", and "unit.rs" for serializing and deserializing data.

3. "UserSession": This is a data structure defined in "model.rs" that represents a user session. It will be used in "lib.rs", "session.rs", "utils.rs", "integration.rs", and "unit.rs".

4. "create_session" and "remove_session": These are function names defined in "session.rs" that will be used in "lib.rs", "integration.rs", and "unit.rs". "create_session" creates a new user session and "remove_session" removes an existing user session.

5. "login" and "logout": These are function names defined in "lib.rs" that will be used in "integration.rs" and "unit.rs". "login" handles user login and "logout" handles user logout.

6. "assert_eq": This is a macro used in "integration.rs" and "unit.rs" for asserting that two expressions are equal to each other.

7. "test": This is a macro used in "integration.rs" and "unit.rs" for marking test functions.

8. "Cargo.toml": This file will contain the shared dependencies for all the Rust files. It will list the packages that the Rust project depends on and will allow the Rust compiler to compile the project.
